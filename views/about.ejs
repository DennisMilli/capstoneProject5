        Most people see shoemaking and software engineering as worlds apart. I see them as the same discipline. As a Shoemaker, I learned that a product is only as good as the foundation it sits on; The obsession with detail is identical.<br><br>
        Over the last year, I've committed to the Angela Yu Full Stack Bootcamp. This portfolio is the documentation of that shift: 5 Capstones, 100 days of discipline, and a lifetime of building.

            This project was my first real confrontation with the web as a system, not a canvas. Using pure HTML, I focused on semantic layout, accessibility, and clarity — learning how information should be ordered, not just displayed. There were no shortcuts here, only fundamentals. Every tag had a purpose. This project taught me that before anything can scale, it must first make sense.

            Once structure was clear, I turned to presentation. This project merged my background in physical craftsmanship and design with the digital world. Through CSS, Flexbox, and Grid, I explored balance, spacing, and responsiveness — how a site should feel across devices. It wasn’t about adding effects, but about control. I learned that good design isn’t loud; it’s intentional. Just like a well-made product, it should disappear into use.

          <P class="muted">
            Static pages eventually felt limiting. This project marked my shift from layout to logic. Using Node.js, Express, and EJS, I built a blog application where content could be created, rendered, and managed dynamically. For the first time, the server made decisions. I began thinking in flows — requests, responses, state, and reuse. This was where I stopped building pages and started building systems.

          <P class="muted">
            After learning how to control my own data, the next step was understanding external data.
            This project focused on consuming real-world APIs using Axios and transforming raw responses into usable interfaces. I learned how modern applications communicate, fail, recover, and adapt. It introduced me to uncertainty — latency, errors, incomplete data — and how to design around it. The web, I realized, is a network, not a silo.

            Everything converges here. This project combines databases, live APIs, analytics, and presentation into a single system built for modern football fans. It connects live scores, structured data, charts, and fan-driven analysis into one evolving platform. More than a blog, it’s an engine — designed to grow, adapt, and inform. This isn’t about displaying information anymore. It’s about designing systems where insight emerges naturally. <br>
            A full-stack blog and analysis dashboard built for the modern fan.
